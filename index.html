				<p>Take a look at the world through the viewfinder of Shane Cruz. Over the past few years, my focus has been in photography and multimedia design. I started out using traditional media, including oil, acrylic, water color and later took on digital painting using Photoshop and Illustrator. Most recently, I have been exploring 2D logo animations and simple animated sequences using After Effects, importing graphics generated in Illustrator. I have many interests and always look forward to learning new skills; Iâ€™m always up for a challenge. I look forward to working with you.</p>
